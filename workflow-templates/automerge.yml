# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule
#
# You probably want to have the following requirements checked:
# - Require a pull request before merging
# - Require approvals (1)
# - Require status checks to pass before merging
# - Require conversation resolution before merging
# - Require linear history
# - Do not allow bypassing the above settings
